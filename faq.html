  <li><strong><a name="a1"></a>What is alcohol?</strong> Ethyl alcohol, or ethanol, is an intoxicating ingredient found in beer, wine, and liquor. Alcohol is produced by the fermentation of yeast, sugars, and starches. <sup>18</sup></li>
  <li><strong><a name="a2"></a>Is beer or wine safer to drink than liquor?</strong> No. One 12-ounce beer has about the same amount of alcohol as one 5-ounce glass of wine, or 1.5-ounce shot of liquor. It is the amount of ethanol consumed that affects a person most, not the type of alcoholic drink. There is some evidence that moderate drinking can potentially be good for your health. The research is still a bit muddled, but what you drink seems to matter less than how much. Red wine has received a lot of publicity for its potential to improve heart health. Many researchers link these benefits to the antioxidants present in wine in the form of resveratrol. In the Copenhagen Heart Study, Danes who drank red wine had only half the risk of dying from heart disease compared to Danes who didn't drink red wine. Some American studies confirm this finding, while other research indicates similar health benefits for drinkers of white wine, beer, and liquor. There is less evidence on the health benefits of alcoholic drinks other than red wine. As with many of life's pleasures, enjoying the benefits of alcohol requires moderation. Drink too much, and alcohol can have various negative effects on physical and mental health including heart and liver damage, and increased risk of cancer, depression, violence, and relationship troubles. People who don't drink already should not be misled by these potential health benefits. There are plenty of non-alcoholic ways to reduce your risk of heart disease and diabetes such as a eating a well-balanced diet and keeping physically active. <sup>17,18</sup></li>
  <li><strong><a name="a3"></a>What does moderate drinking mean?</strong> There is no one definition of moderate drinking, but generally the term is used to describe a lower risk pattern of drinking. According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans,1 drinking in moderation is defined as having no more than 1 drink per day for women and no more than 2 drinks per day for men. This definition is referring to the amount consumed on any single day and is not intended as an average over several days. <strong>What do you mean by heavy drinking?</strong> For men, heavy drinking is typically defined as consuming an average of more than 2 drinks per day. For women, heavy drinking is typically defined as consuming an average of more than 1 drink per day. <sup>18</sup></li>
  <li><strong><a name="a4"></a>What is binge drinking?</strong> According to the <a href="http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/">National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</a> (NIAAA), binge drinking is defined as a pattern of alcohol consumption that brings the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level to 0.08% or above. This pattern of drinking usually corresponds to 5 or more drinks on a single occasion for men or 4 or more drinks on a single occasion for women, generally within about 2 hours.<sup>3,18</sup></li>
  <li><strong><a name="a5"></a>Is it safe to drink alcohol and drive?</strong> No, alcohol use slows reaction time and impairs judgment and coordination, which are all skills needed to drive a car safely.2 Any amount of alcohol, even a few sips or swallows, can impair someone’s ability to operate a motor vehicle; understand there is no “completely safe” amount of alcohol to consume and subsequently drive. Of course, the more alcohol consumed, the greater the impairment.18 <strong>How to prevent drunk driving? </strong>There are many different elements to throwing a fun, successful event. You have to invite compatible people, do something entertaining (via a theme, perhaps), and, hopefully, keep partiers feeling welcome and engaged. But one thing that often gets overlooked is what happens when it's time to go home. Concerned friends, family members, and colleagues all over the world are often faced with your very question. Keep in mind that there's more to keeping those you care about safe than just taking their keys and keeping them off the road. With some thoughtful planning, you may be able to stave off mishaps without having to pull out the sleeper sofa and serve breakfast to a hung-over crowd.<br />
    <br />
    Depending on the type of social situation and setting, you may want to try different strategies. Instead of waiting until the party's over to deal with drunk driving Here are some ideas that people have used successfully: <br /><br />
  <strong>Before a party:</strong>

  <ul>
    <li>Develop a theme for your party or event. Decorate the space and be sure to provide entertainment. </li>
    <li>Set up the room so that the area where alcohol is served is not the first thing people see. You don't want the bar to be the center of attention. </li>
    <li>Provide non-alcoholic drinks — enough for both underage and non-drinking attendees to have plenty of options, and display these as prominently as the alcoholic beverages. </li>
    <li>Prepare lots of yummy food. A mouth-watering buffet is sure to keep people's attention and support efforts toward moderate and responsible alcohol consumption. Especially good options are snacks high in protein and carbohydrates, such as cheese and crackers, chips and guacamole, or buffalo wings. Avoid serving too many salty snacks though, as these tend to make people thirsty. </li>
    <li>Always measure the amount of alcohol put into punches and mixed drinks. </li>
    <li>Using smaller cups helps people keep their alcohol servings to an appropriate size. Each drink should contain no more than 1/2 ounce of pure alcohol. In general, this means 12 oz. of beer, 5 oz. of wine, or one mixed drink with 1-1/2 oz of liquor. </li>
  </ul><br />
  <strong>During a party:</strong>

  <ul>
    <li>You may want to collect keys or encourage some of your guests to designate drivers who won't drink any alcohol. Remember that even one drink can impair motor skills and judgment, the two things needed most to drive safely. </li>
    <li>Respect party attendees who choose not to drink alcohol. </li>
    <li>Avoid drinking games. This will help to cut down on rapid and over consumption. </li>
    <li>When serving drinks, pace your friends to one drink per hour, and encourage them to drink non-alcoholic beverages in between (this can, sometimes, help prevent hangovers). </li>
    <li>Have a reliable friend or family member, or a hired professional, serve the drinks. This will discourage your guests from mixing their own, and help keep track of the size and number of drinks they consume. </li>
    <li>Don't feel pressured to serve anyone who has already had enough to drink. </li>
    <li>Plan to stop serving alcohol about 90 minutes before the party ends. This will give your party-goers some time to process the alcohol they have consumed before they go off into the night. </li>
  </ul><br /><br />
 <strong>After a party:</strong>

  <ul>
    <li>Try to speak to each of your guests before they leave the party. Trust your instincts — if you think someone is ill-equipped to drive, call a cab and pay for it yourself, arrange a ride with a friend, drive her/him home yourself, or encourage her/him to stay over. </li>
    <li>ECU has Pirate Express as well as Safe Ride available to students who need a safe ride home. Check their websites to find out their days and hours of operation. These two options as well as cabs or sober friends are safe ways your party guests can get home. HOWEVER, please review AND adhere to the rules for Pirate Express and Safe Ride, because these are not mandatory services and can easily be taken away if they are abused.</li>
    <li>When holding a party at a hotel or other banquet facility, arrange for reduced-rate or complimentary rooms for guests. This will encourage them to stay over, rather than drive home while intoxicated. You could also arrange for taxi, limousine, or shuttle-bus service both to and from the party. Advertise this service in party invitations.<sup>17</sup></li>
  </ul>
  </li><li><strong><a name="a6"></a>What does it mean to be above the legal limit&nbsp;for drinking? </strong>The legal limit for drinking is the alcohol level above which an individual is subject to legal penalties (e.g., arrest or loss of a driver's license). 
    <ul>
      <li>Legal limits are measured using either a blood alcohol test or a breathalyzer. </li>
      <li>Legal limits are typically defined by state law, and may vary based on individual characteristics such as age and occupation. </li>
      <li>All states in the United States have adopted 0.08% (80 mg/dL) as the legal limit for operating a motor vehicle for drivers aged 21 years or older. However, drivers under age 21 years are not allowed to operate a motor vehicle with any level of alcohol in their system. <br />
        Note: Legal limits do not define a level below which it is safe to operate a vehicle or engage in some other activity. Impairment due to alcohol use begins to occur at levels well below the legal limit. <sup>18</sup></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a name="a7"></a>What does it mean to get drunk?</strong> “Getting drunk” or intoxicated is the result of consuming excessive amounts of alcohol. Binge drinking typically results in acute intoxication.<br />
    Alcohol intoxication can be detrimental to health for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to:
      <ul>
        <li>Impaired brain function resulting in poor judgment, reduced reaction time, loss of balance and motor skills, or slurred speech; </li>
        <li>Dilation of blood vessels causing a feeling of warmth but resulting in rapid loss of body heat; </li>
        <li>Increased risk of certain cancers, stroke, and liver diseases (e.g., cirrhosis), particularly when excessive amounts of alcohol are consumed over extended periods of time; </li>
        <li>Damage to a developing fetus if consumed by pregnant women;5 and</li>
        <li>Increased risk of motor-vehicle traffic crashes, violence, and other injuries.</li>
      </ul>

  <br />Coma and death can occur if alcohol is consumed rapidly and in large amounts because of depression of the central nervous system. <sup>18</sup><br /><br /></li>

  <li><strong><a name="a8"></a>What health problems are associated with excessive alcohol use? </strong>Excessive drinking both in the form of heavy drinking or binge drinking, is associated with numerous health problems, including but not limited to:
    <ul>
      <li>Chronic diseases such as liver cirrhosis (damage to liver cells); pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas); various cancers, including liver, mouth, throat, larynx (the voice box), and esophagus; high blood pressure; and psychological disorders; </li>
      <li>Unintentional injuries, such as motor-vehicle traffic crashes, falls, drowning, burns and firearm injuries; </li>
      <li>Violence, such as child maltreatment, homicide and suicide; </li>
      <li>Harm to a developing fetus if a woman drinks while pregnant, such as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders; </li>
      <li>Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS); and </li>
      <li>Alcohol abuse or dependence. <sup>18</sup></li>
    </ul>

  <li><strong><a name="a9"></a>What is a safe level of drinking? </strong>For most adults, moderate alcohol use--up to two drinks per day for men and one drink per day for women and older people--causes few if any problems. (One drink equals one 12-ounce bottle of beer or wine cooler, one 5-ounce glass of wine, or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof distilled spirits.)<sup>20</sup><strong></strong></li>
  <li><strong><a name="a10"></a>When taking medications, must you stop drinking?</strong> Possibly. More than 150 medications interact harmfully with alcohol. These interactions may result in increased risk of illness, injury, and even death. Alcohol's effects are heightened by medicines that depress the central nervous system, such as sleeping pills, antihistamines, antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, and some painkillers. In addition, medicines for certain disorders, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease, can have harmful interactions with alcohol. If you are taking any over-the-counter or prescription medications, ask your doctor or pharmacist if you can safely drink alcohol.<br /> 

<strong><br />
Alcohol and Antibiotics? </strong>While health care providers don't think it will &quot;kill you to have a glass of wine now and then,&quot; many do caution against drinking while taking antibiotics. That is, if you're sick enough to need antibiotics, you should probably focus on getting better. &nbsp;Although kidney damage from mixing antibiotics and alcohol is unlikely, the odds of liver damage are higher. Many antibiotics are broken down by the liver, and so is alcohol. Since the liver can only metabolize so much at one time, overloading it with antibiotics and alcohol increases the risk of liver damage. For this reason, anyone with a diagnosed liver condition, such as Hepatitis B or C, should not drink while taking antibiotics. Even without drinking, certain antibiotics can have some uncomfortable side effects. Vomiting and diarrhea are common side effects and can lower the level of the antibiotic in the body, affecting its ability to fight an infection. <br />
  Ultimately, the choice is yours, but you may want to ask yourself some questions: <br /><br />
      <ul>
        <li>What type of antibiotic are you taking? </li>
        <li>How important is it for you to create an ideal environment (in your body) for the antibiotics to fight infection? </li>
        <li>Did your health care provider, pharmacist, or antibiotic package insert warn against drinking? </li>
        <li>Do you notice that the antibiotic alone makes you feel nauseated? What if drinking makes you feel even worse? </li>
        <li>Is your liver already compromised by a pre-existing condition (e.g. hepatitis)? </li>
      </ul>
  <br />Keep in mind that your health care provider and pharmacist can be great sources of information and advice about interactions of specific antibiotics and alcohol. If you decide not to mix the two, at worst, you may only need to steer clear of your beloved glass of <em>vino</em> while the drugs run their short course against whatever infection is troubling you. &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Alcohol and Antihistamines? </strong>Antihistamines relieve the runny nose, itchy eyes, sneezing, and other annoying symptoms associated with allergies and colds. Many antihistamines, however, cause drowsiness, so when combined with the sedating effects of alcohol, feelings of drowsiness are magnified. There are now non-drowsy antihistamines, however, people who use these non-drowsy antihistamines need to be aware of possible incidents of low blood pressure and physical falls among the elderly. Keeping this in mind, one may want to refrain from or limit any alcohol use while taking antihistamines. Alcohol changes how medications, including antihistamines, become accessible to the human body. For example, if a person takes an antihistamine while drinking one to several alcoholic drinks over the course of four to five hours (acute drinking), the same metabolizing enzymes that process the antihistamine will attempt to metabolize the alcohol, as well. This exchange could reduce the progression of antihistamines being absorbed into the bloodstream, making the antihistamine less effective. On the other end of the spectrum, long-term drinkers may constantly activate the same enzymes used to metabolize antihistamines that also process alcohol. A chronic drinker, in this case, could develop a tolerance to antihistamines, and it would take more of the antihistamines to be effective. Most warning labels on antihistamines state not to take them if one imbibes more than three alcoholic drinks daily. Similarly, it is important not only not to drive when you drink alcohol, but also not to drive or expect your body to respond with quick reflexes if you drink and use antihistamines. To be safe, it's healthier and less risky not to mix antihistamines and alcohol. Interactions of alcohol and medications are estimated to be involved in possibly at least 25 percent of emergency room admissions. It's in your best interest to discuss your concerns with your prescribing medical provider.<br /><br /><strong>Alcohol and The Pill? &nbsp;</strong>Luckily for women who enjoy sex, responsible drinking, and the pregnancy-protection that the pill provides, alcohol does not decrease the effectiveness of birth control pills. The chances of becoming pregnant while taking the pill are 1 out of 100 when the pill is used correctly (3 out of 100 is the stat for average users, accounting for possible missed or late pills). These rates are not changed by alcohol use. However, what drinking alcohol can change is the likelihood of missing a dose of the pill because of intoxication, and the chances of contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI) due to an intoxication-induced impairment of judgment. While the effectiveness of birth control pills are not impacted, biologically, by alcohol, the hormones in birth control often reduce the liver's ability to metabolize the ethanol in alcohol. This leads to higher blood alcohol concentrations in ladies on the pill and intensifies the effects of intoxication. In plain English, your girlfriend might get drunker quicker. While drunk, she could forget to take her pill at approximately the same time she does each day. If she's taking a progestin-only pill, that could be a problem. This pill's effectiveness is at risk if not taken at close to the same time each day, with a margin of error of about three hours. Estrogen and progesterone pills are not quite as time-sensitive, but women who miss a dose should take the next pill as soon as they remember, and to be extra sure they may want to use a back-up as well. Intoxication can also cause a woman to vomit, which, if she's taken her pill recently could jeopardize its effectiveness. Finally, being drunk could inhibit a woman's judgment, and she may forget or chose not to use a condom when she normally would in order to guard against STIs. If you and your girlfriend have each been tested for STIs, and are sexually active exclusively with each other, this may not be a problem. But for women with more than one partner condoms are essential to preventing STIs. Alcohol intake has been shown to decrease the use of such protection, which is essential for guarding against STIs, including HIV. Props to you for staying well-informed about birth control and making healthier choices regarding sexual health and reproductive health for you and your girlfriend. Knowing what's rumor and what's fact may help you enjoy the timeless combination of alcohol and sex in a responsible and safe way. <sup>17,18</sup><br /><br /></li>

  <li><strong><a name="a11"></a>What is the difference between alcoholism and alcohol abuse?</strong> Alcoholism or alcohol dependence is a diagnosable disease characterized by several factors, including a strong craving for alcohol, continued use despite harm or personal injury, the inability to limit drinking, physical illness when drinking stops, and the need to increase the amount drunk to feel the effects.4 Alcohol abuse is a pattern of drinking that results in harm to one’s health, interpersonal relationships, or ability to work. Certain manifestations of alcohol abuse include failure to fulfill responsibilities at work, school or home; drinking in dangerous situations, such as while driving; legal problems associated with alcohol use; and continued drinking despite problems that are caused or worsened by drinking. Alcohol abuse can lead to alcohol dependence.<sup>4</sup></li>
  <li><strong><a name="a12"></a>How do I know if I have a drinking problem?</strong> Drinking is a problem if it causes trouble in your relationships, in school, in social activities, or in how you think and feel. If you are concerned that either you or someone in your family might have a drinking problem, consult your personal health care provider. <sup>18</sup></li>
  <li><strong><a name="a13"></a>What can I do if I or someone I know has a drinking problem?</strong> Consult your personal health care provider if you feel you or someone you know has a drinking problem. Other resources include the National Drug and Alcohol Treatment Referral Routing Service available at 1-800-662-HELP. This service can provide you with information about treatment programs in your local community and allow you to speak with someone about alcohol problems.<sup>6</sup> &nbsp;<strong>Helping a sibling who may have a problem? </strong>Situations like these are challenging. No doubt, sibling relationships can be tricky and stressful. Your sibling is experiencing one of life's big transitions — moving away from home, perhaps for the first time, to go to college. People adjust to these kinds of life changes in all sorts of ways, and your sibling seems to be making some risky choices. Excessive drinking impairs judgment and affects behavior. Since your previous attempts to talk with your sibling made him/her defensive, you might be wondering if other strategies might be more effective. <em><u>How to start the conversation with your sibling: </u></em>What about striking up a conversation about drinking? You might consider focusing the conversation not necessarily about drinking alcohol at parties, or drinking too much, but rather about the social scene. What about a chat about drinking culture at parties in general, along with flirting, dancing, safer clubbing, etc.? You could start by saying, &quot;So, what was the scene like at the party last night?&quot; or, &quot;Did you have fun?&quot; or, &quot;Were there any hot people there?&quot; If the conversation becomes fairly comfortable, you can talk about some of the risks associated with certain decisions. Or, maybe the messages you want to get across would be better received from someone else: perhaps friends. Maybe a roommate or a resident advisor (RA) could talk with your sibling. Being a responsible friend, or in your case, sibling, sometimes means involving people who can most effectively help. Maybe your parents need to know; perhaps they would be best at connecting with your sibling. Clueing your parents in on what is happening is not being a tattletale; it's being responsible, caring, and compassionate. It's understandable that you're worried about upsetting your sibling, and it is okay to upset him/her by calling out the troops when safety is at risk. In the meantime, have you tried strategies like giving your sibling money for cab fare? That way, he/she has another option to get home if need be, and you have let reemphasized the importance of taking advantage of a safety net. You may also want to work with a professional, like a counselor or health educator. These people can help you practice what you want to say before talking with your sister, as well as provide you with support regardless of her reaction – it's important to take care of yourself, too! <sup>17</sup></li>
  <li><strong><a name="a14"></a>Is alcoholism inherited? </strong>Research shows that the risk for developing alcoholism does indeed run in families. The genes a person inherits partially explain this pattern, but lifestyle is also a factor. Your friends, the amount of stress in your life, and the availability of alcohol are factors that may increase your risk for alcoholism. Remember, risk is not destiny. Just because alcoholism tends to run in families doesn't mean that a child of an alcoholic parent will automatically become an alcoholic too. Some people develop alcoholism even though no one in their family has a drinking problem. At the same time, not all children of alcoholic families become dependent on alcohol. <sup>20</sup><strong>What if I am a child of an alcoholic? &nbsp;</strong>You've already gotten beyond one of the hardest steps in the healing process for children of alcoholics: admitting that a parent's use of alcohol has been unhealthy. Often, sons, daughters, wives, and husbands of alcoholic households learn to deny that any problems exist, and instead cover things up. The self-awareness and knowledge about your dad's drinking patterns are one facet of a responsible drinker. &nbsp;Because of genetic and environmental influences, children of alcoholics are about three to four times more likely to develop problems with drinking than children of non-alcoholic parents. To help you get perspective, it might help to know why this seems to happen. Children of alcoholics tend to take on roles that help them adapt to the chaos at home. In an alcoholic household, there's usually a severe lack of role models for expressing emotions positively. So, some children become &quot;placaters,&quot; doing anything to keep peace and to comfort others at their own expense. Some assume an adult role, taking care of younger siblings and even their parents. Others will always adjust to whatever's going on, while there are some who act out at home and/or school as a way to get attention and deflect attention from their parents' drinking. It's common among children of alcoholics to continue in these roles as adults. Many marry or make lifelong commitments to other alcoholics (about 50 percent), and many more develop compulsive behavior patterns, such as alcohol or other drug abuse and/or overeating (about 70 percent).Young and adult children of alcoholics may also face a range of emotional problems. These include a strong sense of guilt, particularly for the parent's drinking; constant anxiety and/or fear of what will happen at home; embarrassment and confusion; an inability to trust others and self; anger; and, depression. Through all of this, you're definitely not alone. In the United States, there are an estimated 30 million people from alcoholic households. That's right, about ten percent of our total population can relate to your concerns. Many of them have gotten help and worked through the difficult issues they face. There are many organizations nationwide that you can contact to find support, help, and other resources. Among them:

Although your parent's trouble with alcohol may have influenced your family life and certain aspects of your adult life, <em>you are in no way at fault</em>. And, while you're probably at more risk for developing problems with drinking because of your family history, you realize that you can make responsible adult decisions about your own alcohol use.&nbsp;You're stepping up to the challenge: you've identified the problem, and you're asking yourself and others how your situation could affect your attitudes about drinking and drinking behavior at school — these are great steps! <sup>17</sup><br />

  <li><strong><a name="a14"></a>Can alcoholism be cured? </strong>No, alcoholism cannot be cured at this time. Even if an alcoholic hasn't been drinking for a long time, he or she can still suffer a relapse. Not drinking is the safest course for people with alcoholism. <sup>20</sup></li>
  <li><strong><a name="a15"></a>Can alcoholism be treated? </strong>Yes, alcoholism can be treated. Alcoholism treatment programs use both counseling and medications to help a person stop drinking. Treatment has helped many people stop drinking and rebuild their lives. <sup>20</sup><strong></strong></li>
  <li><strong><a name="a16"></a>How does alcohol affect a person? </strong>Alcohol affects every organ in the body. It is a central nervous system depressant that is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and intestines into the bloodstream. Alcohol is metabolized in the liver by enzymes; however, the liver can only metabolize a small amount of alcohol at a time, leaving the excess alcohol to circulate throughout the body. The intensity of the effect of alcohol on the body is directly related to the amount consumed. <sup>18</sup></li>
  <li><strong><a name="a17"></a>Why do some people react differently to alcohol than others? </strong>Individual reactions to alcohol vary, and are influenced by many factors, including but not limited to:

      <li><em>Age, </em></li>
      <li>Gender -Generally, men can handle more alcohol than women. This is because women are usually smaller, have more body fat and have lower total body water content than men. Each of these factors contributes to higher concentrations of alcohol in a woman’s system even if she is drinking the same amount as a man., </li>
      <li><em>Race or ethnicity, </em></li>
      <li>Physical condition (weight, fitness level, etc)- A person’s weight affects the distribution of alcohol throughout the body; thus, the smaller the person the less room there is for alcohol to distribute itself., </li>
      <li>Amount of food consumed before drinking, Your stomach lining absorbs alcohol directly into your blood, but food can slow down the absorption rate</li>
      <li>How quickly the alcohol was consumed, Your body will only process about one drink of alcohol each hour; therefore, chugging or taking shots increases your blood alcohol concentration </li>
      <li>Use of drugs or prescription medicines-Since alcohol is a depressant, any illegal, prescription or over-the-counter drug will react with alcohol and may increase intoxication or negative effects.</li>

  <li><strong><a name="a23" id="23"></a>If I drink to relieve stress does this mean I have a problem? </strong>Whether a person has &quot;a problem&quot; with alcohol can't be diagnosed virtually, however the information here can be a guide to thinking about alcohol use and whether it's a problem in your life. Click <strong><u>here</u></strong> (<strong>LINK TO SYMPTOMS OF ALCOHOLISM DOC</strong>)&nbsp; to see some more signs and symptoms of a possible alcohol problem. If one drinks to relieve stress, but that drinking (even more and more each week) doesn't alleviate stress, therein lies one potential problem. Some people who use alcohol in this way become dependent on alcohol, some don't. Even if this relationship with alcohol is not one of dependency, it seems drinking alcohol may be taking the place of more effective stress management techniques that could help someone feel better. Life can be stressful; it's useful for anybody to learn healthy and effective ways of coping with that stress. &nbsp;There are many ways to manage stress; working with a therapist is one way that many people learn ways to deal with their stress, anxiety, and related issues. While all forms of therapy aimed at self-awareness and mastery of one's thoughts and feelings are useful, cognitive behavioral therapy, which aids a client in learning new ways to think about and cope with stressful situations and feelings, has been shown to be especially effective for learning how to deal with stress and for changing unwanted behaviors, such as drinking. Yoga and other forms of exercise may help decrease physical stress in the body, leaving you simultaneously energized and more relaxed. &nbsp;This leads to the next part of your question, <em>how</em> to determine what level of drinking signifies having a problem with alcohol. Alcoholism is usually marked by a pre-occupation with alcohol and impaired control over alcohol intake. It's possible to suffer from a condition less severe than alcoholism called &quot;alcohol abuse,&quot; which refers to drinking that causes health or social problems, but without the physical dependency on alcohol or loss of control over its use. There are a number of clues that might signify having a drinking problem. Some of these include drinking alone, hiding your drinking from others, having 'black out' or memory loss, needing more drinks to feel the alcohol, feeling irritable if you can't drink, and a number of other indicators. The <strong><u><a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/alcohol-use/MH00123">Mayo Clinic</a></u></strong> has a list of questions you can ask yourself, which may help determine whether you have a drinking problem or should seek help. <sup>17, 21</sup></li>
  <li><strong><a name="a24"></a>Is mixing alcohol with energy drinks, Coca-Cola or Mountain Dew safe or risky? </strong>The three mixers described above may taste very different from each other, but what they all have in common is caffeine. Of the three, Red Bull is the most caffeinated, with about 80 milligrams per serving, (about 5 mg less than 8 ounces of brewed coffee). Coca-Cola contains less than half of that, at 34 mg per serving, while Mountain Dew is in the middle at 55 mg per serving. Most other sodas that contain caffeine fall somewhere within this range, while other drinks labeled as energy drinks may contain much more. When caffeine is mixed with alcohol, it can have many different effects on your body. Caffeine acts as a stimulant, while alcohol functions as a depressant. Both of them are diuretics, meaning that drinking the two together can further increase your risk of dehydration (and make you have to go to the bathroom more often). Being dehydrated means your body won't be able to process alcohol as effectively, and may lead to a worse hangover in the morning. The combination of alcohol and caffeine also may exhibit a stronger negative effect on coordination, balance and ability to regulate body temperature. Besides the caffeine level, soda also differs from Red Bull in its carbonation level. Soda usually has more carbonation than Red Bull or other energy drinks. Because carbonation promotes the absorption of alcohol, mixing any sodas with alcohol may also allow the effects of intoxication to be more pronounced. Whichever mixer you choose, keep in mind that sodas and energy drinks both pack anywhere between 100 to 200 calories per serving in addition to the calories from the alcohol. Whenever alcohol enters the picture, remember to drink plenty of water along with the beverage of choice. Snacking may also allow the body to absorb alcohol a bit more slowly (although eventually the body will still absorb all the alcohol), and may help avoid 'crashing' from a sugar or caffeine overload. <sup>17</sup></li>
  <li><strong><a name="a25"></a>Is drinking alcohol once per day versus a lot at one time irregularly better for your health?&nbsp; </strong>To drink a little or a lot (and when), that is the question. Before delving into the details of healthy vs. unhealthy alcohol consumption, it may be wise to consider the psychological aspects of alcohol use. Alcohol can be a pleasant, life-enhancing libation; it can also be a misused, problematic substance. The amount of alcohol that is &quot;unhealthy&quot; may depend as much on the role it plays in your life as it does on physiological effects of alcohol or definitions of alcohol dependence. Have you thought about why you choose to drink alcohol? Do you use it to have a good time? Do you find it necessary to drink to be comfortable in certain situations? Are you experiencing pressure to consume alcohol? As for which drinking behavior is safer, many health care providers would agree that one daily drink falls on the healthier side of the spectrum, while multiple drinks, even irregularly, is headed toward less healthy and certainly more risky behavior. Higher-risk drinking can be defined as having five or more drinks in one sitting for men or four or more for women (on average, women are smaller than men and reach a higher blood alcohol content more quickly, hence the differing standard). However, moderate drinking may not pose a health problem — in fact, some studies have found health benefits in having one drink daily (wine is the most common drink studied), though not all types of alcoholic beverages provide these benefits. Remember, a standard drink is one 12 ounce beer, one 5 ounce glass of wine, or one 1.5 ounce shot of 80 proof distilled spirits. Higher-risk drinking strains the body because the liver can only process a certain amount of alcohol per hour. Chronic or prolonged higher-risk drinking can lead to pancreatitis, various cancers, liver cirrhosis, high blood pressure, heart failure, and other disorders. Even on a single occasion, higher-risk drinking can be detrimental to your health or even life-threatening. For example, alcohol intoxication doubles the risk of heart arrhythmias, particularly arterial fibrillation, which can lead to heart failure and sudden death, even in those who have healthy hearts. Indeed, one quarter of sudden cardiac-related deaths in young men are due to alcohol consumption. You may also want keep in mind the other potential negative consequences of drinking a lot at once (legal troubles, injuries, deciding to have unprotected sex, etc.). Oh, and by the way, the research isn't definitive, but there is a study that suggests that drinking and a big gut are not related. On the other hand, as with any food or beverage, excessive calorie consumption (alcoholic beverages can be fairly calorie dense) can lead to weight gain. If you're concerned about your weight, and think that limiting alcohol might help you bust a developing &quot;beer gut,&quot; then why not try it? <sup>17</sup></li>
  <li><strong><a name="a26"></a>Am I able to lose weight if I drink 3-4 alcoholic drinks on a regular basis, but exercise regularly and eat healthy?&nbsp; </strong>It is difficult, if not impossible, to lose weight while you include 3 to 4 drinks of hard liquor a day. Not only do those 3 to 4 drinks each day have a number of calories, it is difficult for your body to process that much alcohol every single day and could lead to other, non-weight-related, health problems.<strong> </strong>Alcohol contains calories (even hard liquor)&nbsp;and has other effects on your appetite that may interfere with your weight loss efforts. First of all, an ounce of hard liquor (gin, vodka, rum, whiskey, or scotch) contains 64 calories for 80 proof varieties, and 80 calories for those that are100 proof. The proof refers to the percentage of alcohol in the liquor (80 proof is 40 percent alcohol; 100 proof is 50 percent alcohol). The alcohol in your 3 to 4 drinks could be contributing anywhere from 192&nbsp;to 320 calories. That's if you're using only one ounce per drink (many drinks at bars or made at home are made with more than an ounce). If you're also adding a mixer, the calories may soar! Consider that per 8 oz. cup, orange juice contains 111 calories, regular cola or lemon-lime soda pop has about 100 calories, and regular ginger ale, tonic, or quinine water has around 80 calories. If you are having mixed drinks, you can easily be taking in over 500 calories per day from your libations. That's nearly one-third of the minimum total daily intake range of 1,600&nbsp;to 2,400 calories for an &quot;average&quot; sized, moderately active woman.<strong></strong>

<br />In addition to the calories, alcohol interferes with fat burning, something important for weight loss. Normally, the liver metabolizes fats, but when a person drinks, alcohol takes preference. The liver breaks down alcohol for energy first, causing a build-up of fatty acids. What this means is that the body uses the calories supplied from alcohol before it is able to expend the calories from fat. This characteristic is referred to as &quot;fat sparing,&quot; meaning alcohol's presence spares the fat from being utilized for energy. Alcohol also stimulates appetite in many people. This may thwart your weight loss efforts even more.Besides adding empty calories, your alcohol intake may be jeopardizing your health. Messages in the media about alcohol can be quite confusing. Let's start with an explanation about how alcohol Influences your nutritional status, and then about how it impacts your risk for other diseases. First of all, alcohol affects the hormones responsible for fluid balance. As a result, it causes drinkers to urinate frequently, losing body fluids. When thirsty drinkers have another alcoholic beverage, the vicious cycle of urination --&gt; dehydration --&gt; thirst continues. The only way to break the cycle is to have water or another non-alcoholic beverage. Along with the fluids drinkers lose, they excrete important nutrients as well: calcium, magnesium, potassium, and zinc. Alcohol also interferes with the absorption of vitamins B-1 (thiamin), B-6, B-12, and folate. It causes problems in processing Vitamins A and D, too. As a consequence, nutritional deficiencies are often seen in people who over-imbibe alcohol. However, the risk of death from diseases including many types of cancer (colon, breast, liver, and oral), hypertension, liver disease, heart disease, and others is positively linked with alcohol consumption. The greater the amounts of alcohol women drink, particularly at younger ages, the greater the likelihood of death from one of the above-mentioned diseases. This latest study also shows that the risks are lowest for non-drinkers under the age of 35, for both men and women. For 16- to 24-year-olds, risks increase when women drink more than 8 drinks per week and men drink more than 5 drinks per week. Risks also increase with age when women have 8 to 20 drinks a week, and when men have 5 to 34 drinks a week.There are people to talk with who have made similar changes — seeing a nutritionist, your own health care provider or gynecologist, or a counselor may give you a start on a path to healthier behaviors and choices.<sup>17</sup><br /></li>

  <li><strong><a name="a27"></a>How can I help a friend who has had too much to drink? </strong>Taking care of your friends after they've had too much to drink is certainly a noble and important thing to do. It can be a challenging and unpleasant job, though. Any friends who've had a lot to drink need to be taken care of. What you do for them might depend on things like how much they've had to drink, where you are, what other factors are involved (such as other substances: illicit drugs, prescription or over-the-counter medications), and what your own level of intoxication is. One of the key risk-reduction strategies to remember is that if at least one person in your group is completely sober, s/he'll probably be best suited to assess the situation accurately and call for any needed help. Even one or two drinks can impair judgment, making it more difficult to figure out how urgent a situation really is.It might help to start by understanding some of the common signs that someone is intoxicated to the point of concern. A lot of people think that a person needs to be throwing up or passed out to need medical attention. In fact, there are many signs that can indicate a problem. Some to look for are:
    <ul>
      <li>slurred speech </li>
      <li>stumbling or having difficulty maintaining balance and walking independently </li>
      <li>trouble making eye contact </li>
      <li>feeling excessively cold or warm (to oneself or to the touch) </li>
      <li>shortness of breath </li>
      <li>erratic, withdrawn, or aggressive behavior </li>
      <li>queasiness, vomiting, or dry heaving </li>
      <li>a tired stupor </li>
      <li>unconsciousness </li>
    </ul>
  
  
    
  <br />The first thing to do when someone has had a lot to drink is to make sure that s/he doesn't drink any more alcohol. It may help for the person to sit in a quiet place where s/he can relax comfortably. An individual's reflexes and coordination can be severely impaired when intoxicated, so walking around is not the best idea. You also need to make certain that s/he is kept warm, since high blood alcohol levels can lower body temperature, even if the person actually feels warm. If your friends are willing to drink water on their own, you can offer it to keep them hydrated. Dehydration is one of the side effects of drinking because alcohol is a diuretic, meaning that one expels more liquid than is actually taken in. Keeping hydrated won't make someone sober, but it may help him or her to feel better the next day. But remember, drinking water, or black coffee, or eating food will not speed up the process of getting sober — only time will allow the alcohol to work its way through the system and eventually out of the body. (In fact, coffee can make things worse because it, too, causes dehydration, can be a stomach irritant, and will keep your intoxicated friend awake all night!) You might also be wary about encouraging your friends to eat something, unless they say they are hungry or think it will help them to feel better. It could actually make them feel more sick. Eating food after getting drunk isn't the same as eating food before or while drinking. By the time someone is drunk, the alcohol has left the stomach and is being absorbed through the walls of the lower intestine — it's already too late to slow that down. Another thing to remember — never force food or drink down anyone's throat. His or her swallowing/gag reflex may be dulled and this could cause choking. If your friends feel like lying down, make sure they are on their side, with something behind their back to prevent rolling over onto the back or stomach. If they vomit while on their back, they can choke. On their stomach, there is a risk of drowning by breathing in the vomit. If your friends feel ill and want to get up and visit the restroom, someone should accompany them. It may sound silly, but bathrooms are cold, hard, and often wet — an unsafe environment for someone who is unsteady, has poor coordination, and is ill. If your friends fall asleep, someone needs to stay with them and check continually to ensure that they are breathing normally. Many people don't realize the difference between someone who is sleeping and one who is at risk for (or already is) becoming unconscious. If someone is tired after drinking, that may be normal. Alcohol is a depressant. Therefore, it slows all of the body's functions down. If a person is sleeping, s/he can be woken up, and perhaps moved to a safe location or talked with. Someone who is unconscious will not respond to gentle shaking or being spoken to. You may notice that the person is breathing slowly or shallowly. S/he may feel cold to the touch or have blue-ish lips. An unconscious individual needs immediate medical attention. In large amounts, alcohol will dull the nerves that regulate one's breathing, heartbeat, and gag reflex. This could lead to injury, or even death. If there are any signs that your friend is having trouble breathing, is severely ill, or is already unconscious, call 911 immediately to get an ambulance. If you are unsure of what to do or how drunk s/he really is, err on the side of caution and call anyway. Some people, especially college students, are afraid of getting into trouble if they need to call for help. Some decide to leave their drunk friends to fend for themselves because of this concern. This is dangerous, and even life threatening. It's more important, and in fact your responsibility, to see that your friends have the help they need. <sup>17</sup><br /><br /></li>

  <li><strong><a name="a28"></a>If I’m at a party and I feel that the atmosphere is getting aggressive (or heading that way) how can I facilitate a safe resolution to the issue?</strong>

<br />This is another area where it's important to err on the side of caution. On the one hand, you can try to step in if you feel comfortable, and sober enough, to do so. On the other, your safety, and that of your friends, is the first priority. Sometimes the best thing to do is to get you and your friends out of the situation, or at least away from the &quot;action,&quot; or call for help. You can ask a bartender, club manager or bouncer, or security/police personnel for assistance. If it is your friends who are behaving in an unsafe way, intervening can be awkward. But again, your safety, and ultimately theirs, is at stake. You always have a right to speak up if you feel that someone is acting in an inappropriate way. In fact, this brings up one other point. If you find that your friends are repeatedly drinking to the point where they are unable to care for themselves, are making decisions with poor judgment, or are acting aggressively, it may be time to think about your own boundaries and limits. Is that really the environment you want to spend time in with people you care about? Is cleaning up vomit, holding people's heads in the toilet, breaking up fights, or worrying about someone really a fun way to spend a weekend? In addition, always being willing to sort things out and be the coordinator in some ways enable your friends to keep making the same mistakes. In the end, this could lead to resentment on your part, or some pretty destructive patterns in their own lives. You might want to think about how their behavior really affects you and find a way to tell them how you feel about it. <sup>17</sup><br /><br /></li>

  <li><strong><a name="a29"></a>What are “black outs?” Can people get so drunk that they are able to walk around and talk to people, yet they do not remember anything?</strong>

<br />Yes, indeed. Blackouts, defined as periods of amnesia (memory loss), are caused when alcohol consumption levels prevent the formation of memories in the brain. These levels vary from person to person, and the time frame of these memory lapses is not always marked by visible altered states of consciousness. For example, you and your friends could go to a bar tonight, have some drinks, and talk about politics. But tomorrow, when your friends recall in detail the previous evening's discourse, you may not recall the actual conversation even though you were a full and competent participant. This point is important because blackouts are often confused with passing out, which does constitute a change in consciousness. Blackouts are common among alcohol abusers and can be a warning sign to drinkers and their friends that alcohol-related problems exist. Blackouts are also considered an early high-risk indicator of alcoholism. For problem and healthy drinkers alike, blackouts are often troubling or traumatic when serious and typically unforgettable occurrences are impossible to remember, such as... I don't recall slapping her! You're kidding, I took my pants off and danced on the bar? Did I have sex with that guy last night? Or even, was he wearing a condom? It can be pretty sobering to realize that, in the end, we are responsible for our actions, whether we remember them or not. It's too bad when we forget, for life, really pleasurable things like a party, meeting new people, or intimate moments of sexual pleasure. If you are concerned about your own blackouts, or the memory-challenging episodes of others, cutting back or setting limits on alcohol intake is one option. If the problem is chronic, and a symptom of more serious drinking or other drug use, professional support or assistance is the next step.

  <li><strong><a name="a30"></a>How much alcohol is too much to drink per day? </strong>What's &quot;too much&quot; alcohol for a person will vary, based on a number of factors. Thinking about the immediate effects of alcohol consumption, the extent to which alcohol impacts health and behavior is directly related to blood alcohol concentration (sometimes called BAC). A person's BAC varies, depending on the amount of alcohol consumed and how quickly it's metabolized. Metabolism can be affected by such factors as body weight, amount of body fat, and gender. Women naturally have less of the enzyme necessary for alcohol to be broken down in the stomach, which causes more alcohol to go directly into the bloodstream before it is processed. When alcohol is consumed, it passes from the stomach and intestines into the blood, a process called absorption. While all ingested alcohol is eventually absorbed, the rate of absorption is determined by factors including the amount of food in your system, the rate at which you consume alcohol, the type of drink, and other medications or drugs in your system. To prevent over-intoxication, a person needs to absorb less alcohol than they can metabolize. For most people, the liver can metabolize approximately one drink per hour. A drink is one and a half ounces of standard 80-proof liquor, 12 ounces of beer, or a 5 ounce glass of wine. When thinking about alcohol use over the longer-term, guidelines for light to moderate drinking include limiting alcohol intake to one drink or less a day for women and two drinks or less per day for men. Health risks are more likely to increase as more alcohol is consumed. According to the <u>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</u> (NIAAA), heavy drinking is considered 4 or more drinks a day or more than 14 drinks in a week for men and 3 drinks or more a day or more than 7 drinks a week for women. Drinking heavily is associated with several health consequences including chronic diseases (cirrhosis, cancer, and high blood pressure), as well as unintentional injuries, violence, and alcohol abuse or dependence. <sup>17</sup></li>

  <li><strong><a name="a31"></a>I am starting to realize that I am not able to control my drinking when I go out. I do not crave alcohol, yet when I end up at a bar or club I end up drinking too much! Am I an alcoholic? Where can I get help? </strong>

<br />Before you diagnose yourself as an alcoholic, it might be helpful to look at these three definitions: <br />

  <ul>
    <li>An <em>abuser</em> uses alcohol and/or other drugs in ways that threaten her/his health and well-being, and compromises her/his ability to function in social, family, and/or work situations. </li>
    <li>Someone <em>addicted</em> to alcohol and/or other drugs <em>needs</em> to take these drugs and <em>needs</em> to increase her/his dosage over time to maintain the effects of the drugs. An addict's pattern of use is compulsive, and withdrawal symptoms occur when drug use has stopped&nbsp;— and disappear when drug use has resumed. </li>
    <li><em>Alcoholics</em> have the disease of alcoholism; which can be defined by the interaction of biological, psychological, and social factors. Here are examples of these factors: 
      <ul>
        <li><em>Biological</em>: Genetic differences that predispose someone to alcohol abuse. Sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters of alcoholics are more likely to become alcohol abusers themselves. </li>
        <li><em>Psychological</em>: Personality and psychological traits that predispose someone to alcohol abuse, including self-medicating unpleasant feelings and depression. </li>
        <li><em>Social</em>: Environmental factors supporting alcohol abuse&nbsp;— things like job stress, insufficient employment and/or financial resources, relationship problems, and peer pressure to drink. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br /><br />Some people's problem drinking is situational: they may only abuse alcohol when they are in certain environments or when there are specific &quot;triggers&quot; present. Since you've noticed that you drink too much when you're in clubs and bars, these physical places might be triggers for you. There are other influences you may want to consider, too: when you go out drinking, are you with the same people? Do they also drink too much? Do you only go out when you're stressed out or upset about something? If you can identify the circumstances around your excessive drinking, you may be able to avoid them in the future or address any underlying issues. &nbsp;<br /><br />
  <strong>Here are some warning signs of problem drinking:</strong><br /><br />
    <ul>
      <li>Getting in trouble with family, roommates, significant others, friends, a resident adviser (RA), or the law as a result of drinking. </li>
      <li>Drinking to escape worries or troubles. </li>
      <li>Becoming unreasonably angry or aggressive&nbsp;— fighting, vandalizing, forcing sex, etc. </li>
      <li>Missing class or work due to drinking, or being hung over. </li>
      <li>Having to drink more and more to get the &quot;desired effect,&quot; or drinking more than you planned to. </li>
      <li>Not remembering parts of what happened the night before (blackouts), or wanting to forget parts of what happened (having regrets). </li>
      <li>Having unsafe sex, which could result in a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or unintended pregnancy. </li>
      <li>Regularly drinking until you're drunk, or drinking solely to get drunk. </li>
      <li>Trying to cut down, but not being able to. </li>
      <li>Rapidly drinking the first two or three drinks in an effort to get drunk quickly. </li>
      <li>Beginning to experience unexplained anxiety, sleeping trouble, lethargy, depression, or feelings of alienation or isolation. </li>
      <li>Joking about your drinking, or avoiding discussion of your usage. </li>
      <li>Driving under the influence (DUI) / Driving while intoxicated (DWI). </li>
    </ul>
  <br /><br />No one person would exhibit all of these signs, but if you feel that several of them are just a little too familiar, you might want to speak with a counselor, or call a hotline. <sup>17</sup><br /><br /></li>
